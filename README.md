# Loggly Graph Tools

This is a set of extensions to the loggly cloud logging service (www.loggly.com) 
that will add additional graphing featues.

The current features include

  * A line graph that will plot values from your logged data, useful if you
  * are capturing performance data in your logs and want to see a visual 
  * representation of it.
  
This project is being developed on cloud9 (http://c9.io/owenssam/loggly-graphtools),
contributions welcome.
